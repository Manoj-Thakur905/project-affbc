          When you are studying at a college or university, you may not always
          have the opportunity to apply what you are learning in a real world
          setting. Internships provide the opportunity to take what you are
          learning in the classroom and actually use it.

          We focus on specific, achievable goals rather than boiling the ocean.

          challenges rather than attempting a full scale transformation.
